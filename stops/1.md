Replace this section of text with the full transcript of your audio guide stop. Use a second level heading to flag the person speaking

## Person speaking (second level heading)

> And this blockquote is styled to make it clear that this section really is someone speaking.

And we can go back to a normal transcript.

### A third level heading

The example audio used here is borrowed from [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/connect/sounds/index.html#Discovery) under the terms of their [usage guidelines](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/guidelines/index.html). This is just a test clip, so you'll need to replace it!
